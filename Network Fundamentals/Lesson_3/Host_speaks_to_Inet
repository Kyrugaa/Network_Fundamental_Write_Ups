LESSON 3 - EVERYTHING HOSTS DO TO SPEAK ON THE INTERNET: PART 1


First example: Hosts communicating to another host in the same network

Host A: 	MAC: 	a2a2
		IP:	10.1.1.22
		Subnet:	255.255.255.0

Host B:		MAC:	b3b3
		IP:	10.1.1.33
		Subnet:	255.255.255.0
		

Host A and B are directly connected
	Both hosts have a NIC(Network Interface Card), and therefore a MAC address
	Both hosts are configured with an IP address and a Subnet Mask
		Subnet Mask identifies the size of the IP Network

Host A has some Data to send to Host B
	Networking doesn't care what this data is - its just 1 and 0
Host A knows the IP address of Host B
	Maybe user typed: ping 10.1.1.33
	Maybe IP address was aquired from DNS (converts Domain Name into a IP address)
Host A knows 10.1.1.33 is in its own IP Network
Host A can create the L3 header to attach to the Data
	Layer 3 - End to End
	SRC: 10.1.1.22
	DST: 10.1.1.33
Host A does not know Host B's MAC address
	Host A must use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to get Host B's MAC address
Host A uses ARP to resolve target's MAC address
	ARP Request asks for the MAC address associated with target IP
		ARP Request includes sender's MAC address
		ARP Request is a Broadcast - sent to everyone on the Network
			Destination MAC address: ffff.ffff.ffff
			Reserved MAC address to send a packet to everyone on the local network
	He asks: If anyone out there has the IP 10.1.1.33, send me your MAC. My IP/MAC is 10.1.1.22 / a2a2
	ARP request contains L2 header(take ARP payload and deliver it to Host B)
	
Host A uses ARP to resolve target's MAC address
	ARP Request asks for the MAC address associated with known IP
	ARP Mappings are stored in an ARP Cache
	
	ARP Cache of Host A: 10.1.1.22 --> ??
	ARP Cache of Host B after recieving request: 10.1.1.33 --> a2a2 (L2 ARP response)
Host B response: "I am 10.1.1.33, my MAC is b3b3
	Response is sent Unicast (directly to Host A)

Host A creates L2 header
	Layer 2 - Hop to Hop
	
Data is sent to Host B
	L2 header is discarded
	L3 header is Discarded
	Data is processed by Application
	
	
Host B has necessary information to respond
	ARP cache is already populated

Further data exchange between hosts is simple
	Both hosts have what they need to create L3 and L2 headers

LESSON 3 - EVERYTHING HOSTS DO TO SPEAK ON THE INTERNET: PART 2

Host communicating to another host in a foreign network:


Host A:		MAC:	a2a2
		IP:	10.1.1.22
		Subnet:	/24 (other way to represent 255.255.255.0

Router:		MAC:	e5e5
		IP:	10.1.1.1
		Subnet	/24
		
Host C:		MAC:	c4c4
		IP:	10.9.9.44
		Subnet:	/24
		
Anything with an IP-Address has a ARP Cache

Host A has some data to send to Host C
	Host A knows Host C's IP address
		Provided by the User or the Application
	Host A knows Host C's IP address is on a foreign network by looking at the both IP addresses

Because Host A knows Host C's IP address he can create a L3 header.
	Layer 3 - End to End:
	SRC:	10.1.1.22
	DST:	10.9.9.44
Host A needs to create a L2 header
	Layer 2 - Hop to Hop
	Next Hop is the Router
	
Host A uses ARP to resolve the MAC address of the Router's IP
	Router IP address is configured as the Default Gateway
ARP Request:
	Host A:
	"If anyone out there has the IP 10.1.1.1, send me your MAC. My IP / MAC is 10.1.1.22 / a2a2
	Router:
	"I am 10.1.1.1, my MAC is e5e5

Host A populates ARP Cache with Router's mapping
Host A now has the Routers IP and MAC address in his ARP Cache

Host A creates L2 header
	Layer 2 - Hop to Hop
Data is sent to the Router
	L2 header is discarded
	Router takes over from this point
	Host A's job is done
	
ARP mapping can be used for ANY host in foreign networks
Host A's first step when sending data is always the same:
	Determine if target IP is on local or foreign network
		Foreign	--> ARP for Default Gateway IP
		Local	--> ARP for Target IP
