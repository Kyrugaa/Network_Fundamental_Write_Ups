Lession 2: Part 1

OSI Model, A Practical Perspective


Purpose of Networking:
	Allow two hosts to share data with one another
	
Hosts must follow a set of rules

The rules for Networking are divided into seven layers:
-OSI Model

Human Body is made up various systems:
-Skeletal, Respiratory, Nervous, Cardiovascular, Muscular etc.
-if all these systems are functioning, the Human lives

OSI model divides rules of networking into 7 layers
-Each layer serves a specific function
-if all layers are functioning, hosts can share data(human lives)
__

LAYER 1 - Physical layer
	Computer data exists in the form of Bits(1 and 0)
	Something has to transport those bits between hosts (the physical layer)
	Goal of Physical layer is transporting bits
	L1 Technologies: Cables, Wifi, Repeaters, Hubs
	
	
LAYER 2 - Data Link - Hop to Hop
	Handels everything that allows hosts to hop to the wished target
	Interacts with the Wire(i.e., Physical layer)
	Puts Bits on the Wire and Takes Bits from the Wire
	L2 Technologies: NIC - Network Interface Cards, Wifi Access Cards, Switches
	Addressing Scheme - MAC Addresses
		48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits
		94-65-9C-3B-8A-E5 (Windows) / 94:65:9C:3B:8A:E5 (Linux) / 9465.9C3B.8AE5 (Cisco Routers and Switches)
		Every NIC has a unique MAC Address
	Often communication betwen hosts require multiple hops
	

LAYER 3 - Network - End to End
	Addressing Scheme - IP addresses
		32 bits, representing as 4 octets, each 0-255
	L3 Technologies: Routers, Hosts, (anything with an IP)
			
ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
	Links a L3 address to a L2 address

LAYER 4 - Transport - Service to Service
	Distinguish data streams
	Addressing Scheme - Ports
		0-65535 - TCP - favors reliability
		0-65535 - UDP - favors efficiency
	Server listen for requests to pre-defined Ports
	Clients select random Port for each connection (different applications, z.b. Discord, onlinegame, youtube)


LAYER 5, 6, 7 - Session, Presentation, Application
	Distinction between these layers is somewhat vague
	Other Networking Models combine these into one layer
	L1-L4 are most important to understand how data flows
	OSI Model - 	1 Physical, 2 Data Link, 3 Network, 4 Transport, 5 Session, 6 Presentation, 7 Application
	TCP/IP Model -	1 Network Access, 2 Internet, 3 Host to Host, 4 Application
