 Everything Routers do - Part 1 - Networking Fundamentals - Lesson 5 


Routers:
	Routers are connected to a network (just like hosts)
	Just like hosts, routers have an IP and MAC address and all the rules of Layer 2 and Layer 3 on each interface
	
	Routers forward packets not destined to themselves (unlicke hosts)
	
RFC (Request for Comments) (Instructions for how the internet is build)
	Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6 = RFC 2460)
	
Terminology:
	node	- a device that implements IPv6.
	router	- a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to itself.
	host	- any node that is not a router.


Routers maintain a map of all the Networks they know about.
	Routing Table
	

Interface 1:	Network	= 	10.0.55.x /24
		Host B = 	10.0.55.8 /b8b8
		Router 1 = 	10.0.55.1 /eee3
		
Interface 2:	Network 	10.0.44.x /24
		Host A = 	10.0.44.9 /a9a9
		Host D = 	10.0.44.3 /d3d3
		Router 1 = 	10.0.55.1 /eee1

Router 1 - Routing Table
	For destination 10.0.55.x ...
		Send packet via Interface 1
	
	For destination 10.0.44.x ...
		Send packet via Interface 2
		
Routing Table can be populated via three methods:


	Method 1:
	Directly Connected - Routes for the Networks which are attached:
	
	Router 1 is directly connected:
	DC	10.0.55.x /24 = Interface 1
	DC	10.0.44.x /24 = Interface 2
	
	
Adding a new Router with a new Network

Router 2:	Network =	10.0.66.x /24
		Host C	=	10.0.66.7 /c7c7
		Router 2 Interface 1 =	10.0.55.2 /eee2
		Router 2 Interface 2 = 	10.0.66.2 /eee4
		
		
	Router 2 is directly connected:
	DC	10.0.55.x /24 = Interface 1 on Router 2
	DC	10.0.66.x /24 = Interface 2 on Router 2
	
When Routers receive packets with an unknown Destination IP, packet is dropped

	Method 2:
	Static Routes - Routes manually provided by an Administrator:
	
	Router 2:
	DC	10.0.55.x /24 = Interface 1 on Router 2
	DC	10.0.66.x /24 = Interface 2 on Router 2
	Static	10.0.44.x /24 = Router 1 IP 10.0.55.1
	
	Router 1:
	DC	10.0.55.x /24 = Interface 1
	DC	10.0.44.x /24 = Interface 2
	Static	10.0.66.x /24 = Router 2 IP 10.0.55.2
	
	
	
	Method 3:
	Routes learned automatically from other Routers
	Routers talk to each other and if one Router doesent know the address it sends it to the other Router.
	Basically the same as static. They just do it automatically by talking to each other.
	
	
	
Key Points of Part 1:
	Routers have an IP & MAC for each Network they are connected to
	Routing Table contains all the networks a Router knows
		Populated via: Directly Connected, Static Routes, Dynamic Routes

 Everything Routers do - Part 2 - How Routers forward Packets - Networking Fundamentals - Lesson 5 
 
 Routers also have ARP Tables - mapping of L3 to L2 address
 	Everything with an IP address has an ARP Table
 	Start Empty - populated as needed with network traffic
 	
 Host A has data to send to Host C
 Host A knows IP of Host C so Host A can construct the L3 header.
 Host A knows packet must be sent to Default Gateway (Router 1) because Host C is on a foreign network
 
 Host A ARP Request for 10.0.44.1 (Router 1 or Default Gateway)
 Host A ARP Table:
 10.0.44.1 --> ???
	
Router 1 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.44.9 (Host A)

Router 1 sends ARP Response

Host A populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.44.1:
	Host A ARP Table:
	10.0.44.1 --> eee1

Host A constructs L2 header
	Host A sends packet to Router 1:
	L3 = SRC 10.0.44.9 / DST 10.0.66.7
	L2 = SRC a9a9 / DST eee1

Router 1 receives packet

Router 1 discards L2 header

Router 1 looks up Destination IP in Routing Table
	Packets next hop is to 10.0.55.2
	
Router 1 sends ARP Request for 10.0.55.2 because Router 1 ARP Table:
10.0.44.9 --> a9a9
10.0.55.2 --> ???

Router 2 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.55.1(Router 1)
Router 2 ARP Table now:
10.0.55.1 --> eee3

Router 2 sends ARP Response
Router 1 ARP Table now:
10.0.44.9 --> a9a9
10.0.55.2 --> eee2

Now Router 1 constructs L2 header:
L2 = SRC eee3 / DST eee2, L3 = SRC 10.0.44.9 / DST 10.0.66.7

Router 1 now sends packet to Router 2

Router 2 receives packet

Router 2 discards L2 header

Route 2 looks up Destination IP in Routing Table
	Packets final hop is to 10.0.66.7(DST)
	
Router 2 sends ARP Request for 10.0.66.7

Host C populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.66.2(Router 2)

Host C ARP Table:
10.0.66.2 --> eee4

Host C sends ARP Response

Router 2 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.66.7

Router 2 ARP Table now:
10.0.55.1 --> eee3
10.0.66.7 --> c7c7

Router 2 constructs L2 header

Router 2 sends packet to Host C

Host C reveives packet

Host C discards L2 header

Host c discards L3 header

Host C processes data
________
NOW THE RESPONSE

Host C has data for Host A

Host C constructs L3 header: SRC 10.0.66.7 / DST 10.0.44.9

Host C knows packet must be sent to Deault Gateway (Router 2)
	Host C knows Router 2's MAC from previous communication

Host C constructs L2 header: SRC c7c7 / DST eee4

Host C sends packet to Router 2

Router 2 receives packet

Router 2 discards L2 header

Router 2 looks up Destination IP in Routing Table
	Packets next hop is to 10.0.55.1
	Router 2 knows Router 1's MAC from previous communication

Router 2 constructs new L2 header: SRC eee2 / DST eee3

Router 2 sends packets to Router 1

Router 1 receives packet

Router 1 discards L2 header

Router 1 looks up Destination IP in Routing Table
	Packet's final hop is to 10.0.44.9
	Router 1 knows Host A's MAC from previous communication

Router 1 constructs new L2 header

Router 1 sends packet's to Host A

Host A receives packet

Host A discards L2 header

Host A discards L3 header

Host A processes data
______

Events between Router 2 and Router 1 would repeat for any amount of Routers in the Path

Each Router:
	Looks up Destination IP in Routing Table to determine Next-Hop IP
	Adds a L2 header with Destination MAC next Router's MAC
		Performs ARP as necessary

 Router Hierarchies and Route Summarization - Networking Fundamentals - Lesson 5 - Part 3 
 
 ACME inc.
 
 Routers typically connected in a hierarchy
 	Easier to scale - more consistent connectivity
 	Every Office Router is connected to the main Router which connects to the internet
 	Hierarchy allows for Route Summarization
 		Reduce number of Routes in Routing Table
 		Default Route - ultimate route summary
 			0.0.0.0 /0 - every IPv4 address
 			"For everything else, go here"
 			
 
 Subneting Tipp
 	/24 Match first Three Octets  	##.##.##.xx
 	/16 Match first Two Octets	##.##.xx.xx
 	/8  Match only first Octet	##.xx.xx.xx
 	/0  Match only first Octet	xx.xx.xx.xx --> 0.0.0.0


Key Points:
Routers typically connected in a hierarchy
	Easier to scale
	More consistent connectivity

Hierarchy allows for Route Summarization
	Reduce number of Routes in Routing Table
	Default Route - ultimate route summary
		0.0.0.0 /0 - every IPv4 address
